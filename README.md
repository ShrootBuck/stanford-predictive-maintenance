# Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning to Forecast Failure

Final project for the **Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes**. This project uses ML to forecast manufacturing failures, minimizing costly repairs by prioritizing model recall. Massive thanks to Dr. Jamie Fairclough for being my instructor and guiding me throughout the course & project!
